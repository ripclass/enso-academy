# Session Notes

Running notes between Claude Code sessions. Append observations, partial work, things to remember next time. Cleared and archived periodically by the owner.

Format: ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] — short title

## [2026-05-20] — Initial session

Foundation scaffold completed. Memory system established. Ready for Prompt 2 (Supabase setup).

No partial work. No open threads.

---

## [2026-05-20 22:15] — Supabase + auth done, schema next

Supabase wiring complete. pgvector enabled on the Singapore project. Note: Prompt 2 specified `middleware.ts` but Next.js 16 deprecated that convention — migrated to `proxy.ts` (Ripon approved); ADR 0002 reflects this. Google OAuth credentials still need to be created in Google Cloud Console (see docs/SETUP-google-oauth.md). Database is empty of user tables — Prompt 3 will write the full schema (courses, modules, lessons, students, enrollments, mock exams, student knowledge state, classmate interventions, examiner data, commercial tables). No partial work or open threads from this prompt.

## [2026-05-20 22:45] — Schema applied, ready for Anthropic SDK

Six migrations applied cleanly. ~40 tables across six domains. RLS policies in place. pgvector cache table (cached_qa) ready with similarity-search RPC. One hiccup: the first `db push` failed because the `vector` type sits in the `extensions` schema and was not on the apply-time search_path — fixed with `SET search_path = public, extensions` in the three vector-using migrations + the match_cached_qa function, then re-pushed cleanly (ADR 0003 records the pattern). Next: wire Anthropic SDK and Claude client (Prompt 4). No partial work, no open threads.

## [2026-05-20 23:00] — Schema hardened against Supabase advisors

Ran the Supabase advisor lint (via the /supabase:supabase skill). Upgraded the Supabase CLI 2.53.6 -> 2.100.1 (scoop) to get `db advisors`. Two follow-up migrations (advisor_hardening + fix_subscriptions_rls_initplan) cleared all 4 security + 71 performance WARNs; advisors now report 0 WARN/ERROR. Effective access is unchanged (service_role bypasses RLS) — policies were just scoped and rewritten for performance. Still open from Prompt 3: the enrollment-gated content-read RLS policies were never added (content tables remain service-role-only) — fold into a later prompt. Next: wire Anthropic SDK and Claude client (Prompt 4).
